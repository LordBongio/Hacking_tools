# Hacking_tools
trying to automate several parts of "hacking".


I'm aware the script might be wrote badly,i'm a student (who doesn't study coding) and hints on how to modify/update it are welcome.

I do not take responsibility for the use you make of this script, which simply uses gobuster and nmap and tryes to automate the initial enumeration. 

KNOWN PROBLEMS-MISSING FEATURES:
-the "status" output of gobuster and nmap is displayed which is not intended (altho it is usefull, so i don't have to come up with one of mine).
-the input is really not sanitized, so don't try and break it (it will be easy).
-the standard repository accounts for an installation of SecList wordlists/kali wordlists.
-the output is in your current directory.
